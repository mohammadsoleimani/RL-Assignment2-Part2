# RL-Assignment2-Part2
Part 2 of Assignment 2 implements Monte Carlo methods (exploring starts, ε-soft, off-policy) on a 5x5 gridworld with special states (B, G, R, Y) and terminals. Using γ=0.95, it learns an optimal policy navigating to green (+1). Outputs include value function heatmaps and policy plots. Code runs in ~15–20s, seed=42.
